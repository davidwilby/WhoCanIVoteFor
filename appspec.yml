# During the Install deployment lifecycle event (which occurs between the
#   BeforeInstall and AfterInstall events), copy the specified files
#   in "source" starting from the root of the revision's file bundle
#   to "destination" on the Amazon EC2 instance.
# Specify multiple "source" and "destination" pairs if you want to copy
#   from multiple sources or to multiple destinations.
# If you are not copying any files to the Amazon EC2 instance, then remove the
#   "files" section altogether. A blank or incomplete "files" section
#   may cause associated deployments to fail.
files:
  - source: /
    destination: /var/www/wcivf/code/
# For deployments to Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, or RHEL instances,
#   you can specify a "permissions"
#   section here that describes special permissions to apply to the files
#   in the "files" section as they are being copied over to
#   the Amazon EC2 instance.
#   For more information, see the documentation.
# If you are deploying to Windows Server instances,
#   then remove the
#   "permissions" section altogether. A blank or incomplete "permissions"
#   section may cause associated deployments to fail.
